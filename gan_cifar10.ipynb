For instance, tasks such as Image Classification are one type of discriminative modelling, as the high dimensional images are mapped into low dimensional probabilities of labels.\n",

    "What about generative modelling? In generative modelling, the goal is instead given a data distribution to learn from, to produce or <strong>generate new examples</strong> that follow this distribution but still aim to be unique. Thus, a high performing generative model should be able to create examples that are both <strong>plausible</strong> (in that one can recognize what the generated example is supposed to be of) <strong>and indistinguishable</strong> from real data examples (Brownlee, 2019). Generative models can be Unsupervised or Semi-Supervised, depending on the exact task that one is trying to tackle. \n",

    "In a GAN, there are in fact two networks, a <strong>generator</strong> and a <strong>discriminator</strong> that improve each other by competing in a game scenario (Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville, 2016). The aim is to use the well established field of discriminators to assist the generator. The goal of the generator is to <strong>create realistic images</strong> that appear to be from the distribution of the training images, where as the goal of the discriminator is to determine <strong>if a given image is from the data distribution</strong>. The process goes as follows:\n",

    "### Types of GANs 🍐\n",
    "There many different types of GANs, however I believe the most differing pair is the Vanilla GAN and the Conditional GAN. The Vanilla GAN is what was proposed by Ian Goodfellow in 2014, which consists of the basic architecture with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Conditional GANs are different in the aspect that one can provide additional information to the model, which could be thought of as a form of guidance similar to diffusion models.\n",

    "\n",
    "One may think of Conditional GAN as a more *\"supervised\" version* of Vanilla GANs, as some condition techniques (in the form of perhaps label information) are provided **to support the adversarial training**. Conditional GANs have in fact become **the go-to method of generating high-quality images** (Kang et al., 2021). This may be due to the fact that **when image sizes become larger** and there is **no sense of direction**, there can be a **significant** amount of overlapping generation that occurs.\n",

Below, we attempt to discuss what such that we are able to know what to pay attention to, when developing our GANs as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mode collapse\n",
    "One of the largest and continuing issues with the GAN training process is mode collapse. Mode collapse is said to occur if the generator **maps multiple different vectors** $z$ to the same output of $x$, where $x$ is a vector which the <strong>discriminator assigns high probability of being real</strong> to. In other words, the generator **exploits the discovery** that a particular output can fool the generator and thus ultimately produces, <strong>decreasing the diversity of one's outputs</strong>.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mode Dropping\n",
    "This is another case of decreasing the diversity of one's outputs, however not in the same way as Mode Collapse. In Mode Collapse, diversity is decreased within the classes. However, in Mode Dropping, diversity is decreased **among the classes**. Specifically, the generator may learn that for certain classes, it is difficult to generate an image, sufficiently realistic enough to trick the generator. Thus the generator may learn to simply just ignore these difficult classes, to be the most effective in the game against discriminator."

    "The most straight forward method of telling whether the output of a GAN is good, is to well, use our human eyes. On a smaller-sized experiment or if one is assessing a few images, this may be a valid approach. However, when the amount of data scale up to a very large quantity (which naturally is the case with Deep Learning), the act of visually inspecting every output is **simply infeasible**. Besides, using our eye as a metric means our feedback is **qualitative**. This means if it comes down to comparing the performances of two incredibly well-performing models, it's also difficult for one to tell which one is better. Thus, we need to define a set of quantitative metrics that we can use to substitute the use of our human eyes.\n",

    "What is **Disentangled Latent Space**?\n",
    "Latent space is straight forward, it's the typically smaller representation that in the context of GANs, acts as the input to the generator network. Disentangled latent space means that going along one dimension of the latent space representation, the changes reflected in the output should have only an appropriate level of overlap with outputs achieved by going along a different dimension. Thus, there are a few cases:\n",

    "Above is the context in Variational Auto Encoders, however as the problem statement of generator images to mimic the real distribution is the same, thus the evaluation metrics being the same as well, I use the image to explain how the concept of disentangled latent space in the context of GANs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see there are a total of 3 possible cases:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "\t<li>Insufficient overlap</li>\n",
    "\t<li>Appropriate Overlap</li>\n",
    "\t<li>Too Much Overlap</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of insufficient overlap, we see that moving along the latent distribution $p(z)$ provides the property of independence, in that there are no two latent spaces that affect two features of the output. However, the problem is that the generated image distribution is not, does not take up much of our ideal output distribution $p_{\\theta}(x)$. In the case of too much overlap, as indicated by the large overlapping regions, it tells us that moving along one dimension of the latent space leads to a change in many different images among the distribution (which in this 2d representation can be interpretted as changing too many of the same features). Thus, the ideal or appropriate level of overlap here, as seen in the center image, is where there is a good level of independence, in that moving along one dimension of the latent space vector results to changes associated only with the latent space vector, and where the covered area is also large, taking up most of the space of our distribution $p_{\\theta}(x)$.\n",

    "##### **Measuring Quality**  \n",
    "What we mean by quality here is not the resolution of the image (doesn't make sense for the generator to output high-res images when the training data is low resolution). Here, quality means how well one is able to recognize an image, as the class it is intended to be. The two most popular metrics are **Inception Score** and **Frechet Inception Distance**. The term **inception** comes from the fact that these two metrics **actually use** a pretrained Inception classifier to aid in producing the metric values.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### **Measuring Diversity**  \n",
    "If we simply **focused on quality-measuring metrics**, our models may still be susceptible to something like Mode Collapse or Mode Dropping. We try to aim for a quantitative metric such as:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "\t<li>Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity <strong>(LPIPS)</strong></li>\n",
    "\t<li>Number of statistically-different bins <strong>(NDB)</strong></li>\n",

    "#### Applying **Self-Attention**\n",
    "What is self-attention? Traditional convolution layers are local, in the sense that the scope of interactions between inputs is restricted. If the kernel size is less than the image (which it usually is) then one can know that the top left region on an image will only have some interaction with the bottom right region after a certain number of layers. The attention mechanism introduces **global receptive field**. Specifically, it first identifies the dependencies between different tokens on an input, by performing a dot product between two weighted and position-encoded vector embeddings on the input. This leads to a weight matrix that's essentially **calculated on the fly**. The method of producing tokens are generally dependent on the architecture, with the novel Vision Transformer (ViT) using linear layers, while other transformer architectures such as Convolutional Vision Transformers use Convolution layers to generate tokens. Formally, attention is calculated by:\n",
    "$$\\text{Att}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Q, K, V$ are the token matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of the SAGAN (Self Attention GANs) paper showed that their networks were able to:\n",
    "> leveraging complementary features in distant portions of the image rather than local regions of fixed shape to generate consistent objects/scenarios.\n",
    "(Zhang et al., 2019)\n",
